## What is this?

TL;DR: our docs.

Here you'll find everything from <b>how to contribute</b>, to <b>what the dao is</b> and <b>much more</b>! This is the one-stop-shop for anything you want to know about us :)

If we're missing something, feel free to contribute on the docs within this repo, or ask in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/4PyERzE89X)


## How to contribute?

Highly higly reccomend you pop-up in our working group (WG) channel within the [Discord](https://discord.gg/4PyERzE89X), it is our main point of communication!

Just create a [Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) to this github repository with any changes needed

Up to you for figuring out excact details, but as a general:

* You need Git installed
* You need to clone this repository
* Commit & push all changes
* Pull request to update in offical

You'll see all content in `/pages`, with the .mdx format. This is how we write and format the docs, check a cheatsheet for how to write in markdown [here](https://markdownlivepreview.com/)

## Additional notes
This is a <b>work in progress!</b> even this readme- we've just started and hoping to make a super clean and easy way for people to join & understand the DAOü§ó
