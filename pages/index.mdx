# PadawanDAO

Welcome to [**PadawanDAO**]() â€“ join us on our journey to learn, buidl, and take advantage of some incredible opportunities in Web3! 

PadawanDAO was formed by a group of aspiring young people looking to buidl in the blockchain space. Originally sponsored through Ric Burton and a variety of generous donors, 75 aspiring padawans were granted the opportunity to attend the Fall 2021 ETHLisbon and NFT.NYC conferences. These inaugural padawans came back from their adventures eager to provide the same opportunities to the next generation of aspiring kids. Armored with support from the community, they gathered together to launch the DAO. 

## Our Mission

The mission of the DAO is to financially and educationally empower future cohorts of students and young individuals to attend events and grow within the crypto space. 

The DAO was created with the following principles in mind: 
* Fund students and young individuals to attend blockchain events through an application and proposal process 
* Create an inclusive environment for humans of all backgrounds 
* Encourage crypto education for those interested in joining the industry  
* Receive proposals from aligned parties looking to push forward members and future cohorts
